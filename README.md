# AR-Glasses
FIT3170 Full Year project for AR Shopping List glasses
Handover for the AR-Glasses(hand gestures)
The project can track the hand movement by using an external python script, so it can provide
data to the unity. However, it is a bit hard to implement into Unity, I am looking for other feasible if I can use C# to track the hand gesture directly. Magic leap has a good library for it.https://ml1-developer.magicleap.com/en-us/learn/guides/design-gesture
Due to the limitation of time, we had to pause this functionality.   

User guide
1.Using unity to open this project
2.Ensuing camera is connected, and you need to execute the python script(Asset/scene/object detection/ hand gesture/ fingerdetection/main) externally.
3.Click play button in unity
