# AR-Glasses
FIT3170 Full Year project for AR Shopping List glasses
Handover for the AR-Glasses(hand gestures)
The project can track the hand movement by using an external python script, so it can provide
data to the unity. However, it is a bit hard to implement into Unity, I am looking for other feasible if I can use C# to track the hand gesture directly. Magic leap has a good library for it.https://ml1-developer.magicleap.com/en-us/learn/guides/design-gesture
Due to the limitation of time, we had to pause this functionality.
